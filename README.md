# Covid Running Analysis
**analysis of how the pandemic impacted running trends across various age groups, based on monthly distances ran by 20,000 runners over a two year span.**

Goal: Was COVID running trendy or tiring? How was running affected throughout the pandemic (initial impact, impact based on stringency of lockdown, etc).

Data Context: Dataset is from Kaggle. Data cleaning and engineering were done to make predictions easier. 20,000 distinct runners were randomly sampled from a larger dataset. Analysis was conducted using Python.

Content Summary:

Conducted Data Cleaning / Engineering
Evaluated Performance of Multiple Linear Regression Models
Analyzed Additional Effects of Specific Predictors
